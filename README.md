### Hi there, I'm Rayhan ðŸ‘‹
I am a final year Computer Science student at Gadjah Mada University (UGM) and React.js enthusiast with two years of experience in frontend development. I continuously learn new things about web development and actively build a couple of projects by myself or with other developers. Besides, I'm working as a freelance Python programmer to help non-IT students in their research on data science.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently conducting a research on NLP about author obfuscation in order to complete my coursework at Computer Science.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working as a frontend developer in a new local startup, but still open for a better opportunity to work with and learn from more professional and skillful developers.
