### Hi y'all, I'm <a href="https://rayhannr.vercel.app">Rayhan</a> ðŸ‘‹
I am a final year Computer Science student at Gadjah Mada University (UGM) and React.js enthusiast with two years of experience in frontend development. I continuously learn new things about web development and actively build a couple of projects by myself or with other developers. I'm working as a freelance Python programmer as well to help non-IT students who conduct researches in data science but unable to code.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m working as a frontend engineer trainee in a startup in my hometown.
- ðŸ”­ I'm currently conducting a research on NLP about author obfuscation in order to complete my coursework at Computer Science and learning TypeScript and Next.js in my spare time to stay productive.
