### Hi y'all, I'm <a href="https://rayhannr.github.io">Rayhan</a> ðŸ‘‹
I am a final year Computer Science student at Gadjah Mada University (UGM) and React.js enthusiast with two years of experience in frontend development. I continuously learn new things about web development and actively build a couple of projects by myself or with other developers. Besides, I'm working as a freelance Python programmer to help non-IT students in their data science research.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m working as a frontend developer in a new startup in my hometown, but still open for a better opportunity to work with and learn from more professional and skillful developers.
- ðŸ”­ I'm currently conducting a research on NLP about author obfuscation in order to complete my coursework at Computer Science and learning TypeScript in my spare time to stay productive.
